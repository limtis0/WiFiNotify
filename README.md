# WiFiNotify

This is a simple Android app written in Kotlin, ran as a background serivce.

It is used to notify the user about enabling "metered connection" when connecting to a new network.

This app was written as a freelancing job.

It also serves as a showcase of my knowledge on Android security measures, as well as an ability to write background services.

## Prerequisites
- Android 8+ (SDK 26+)
- Permission to always access geolocation (Due to Android security measures)

Note: For apps below Android 10 (SDK 29) app automatically disconnects from new Wi-Fi networks.
